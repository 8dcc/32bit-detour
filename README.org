*Simple linux library for detour hooking in C.*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description
This is a linux library, and it supports x64 and x86.

If you want to use this library, simply copy the detour source and headers
to your project, include the header in your source files and compile it with the
rest of your code. Please see [[https://github.com/8dcc/detour-lib/blob/main/src/main.c][src/main.c]] for an example on how to use it.

This library was originally made for [[https://github.com/8dcc/hl-cheat][8dcc/hl-cheat]], and was inspired by [[https://guidedhacking.com/threads/simple-linux-windows-detour-class.10580/][this OOP abomination]] ([[https://gist.github.com/8dcc/d0cbef32cd46ab9c73c6f830fa71d999][mirror]]).
